Corner Grocer Grocery Tracking Program
Project Overview

This project is a grocery tracking program written in C++. The program reads a text file that contains a list of grocery items that were purchased during the day and counts how many times each item appears. The goal of the program is to help a grocery store understand which items are purchased the most so they can organize their store better.

The program runs in the console and uses a menu so the user can choose what they want to see.

**Problem Being Solved**

The problem being solved is counting how often grocery items appear in a purchase list. Doing this by hand would take a long time and could cause mistakes. This program automatically counts each item and displays the results in different ways.

**What I Did Well**

I think I did a good job using a class to organize the program and using a map to store the item names and their frequencies. Once the data was stored in the map, it was easy to print the information and create the histogram. I also successfully read data from a file and wrote output to a backup file.

**Areas for Improvement**

One improvement I could make is allowing the user to search for items without worrying about uppercase or lowercase letters. I could also add better error messages if the input file is missing. These changes would make the program easier to use.

**Challenges and How I Solved Them**

The hardest part of this project was working with file input and understanding how maps work. At first, I had trouble making sure the data was being read correctly. I solved this by reviewing the zyBooks examples, testing the program often, and using Visual Studio to debug the code.

**Skills Gained**

This project helped me practice using classes, maps, loops, and file input and output in C++. I also gained experience creating menu-driven programs and debugging errors. These skills will be useful in future programming courses.

**Code Readability and Maintenance**

I tried to keep my code easy to read by using clear variable names, adding comments, and organizing the program into functions. Using a class makes it easier to update or add new features later.

**How to Run the Program**
1)Open the project in Visual Studio
2)Make sure the input file is in the correct folder
3)Build and run the program
4)Follow the menu options
